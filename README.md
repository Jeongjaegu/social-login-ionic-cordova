# Social Login
Social Login allows your users to login and register with 30+ social networks. 
It increases your phpBB user registration rate by simplifying the registration process for 
new users and provides permission-based social data retrieved from the social network profiles.

## Important
You need to setup your OneAll Subdomain in<br /> 
the <b>www/js/app.js</b> file before being able to use the app.

## Debugging
` adb logcat | grep `adb shell ps | grep sociallogin | cut -c10-15`
